<h1>Hello stranger!</h1>

We are Cult of Coders, a company which focuses on developing the best possible applications.
We only work with Meteor, we absolutely love it, and we'd like to teach you how to use it.

During the last few years we've gathered a lot of experience, and we'd like to share that experience with you.
Meteor has changed a lot, and is now fully packed with lots of cool stuff that will enable you to create both
simple and complex enterprise-level applications.

This tutorial will be structured in chapters, which are made up of lessons.

We encourage you to follow along in a practical manner. This way, you will encounter problems, and learn more.
Also, the information will come back to you a lot easier when you work on projects !

<h1>Before you begin</h1>

This tutorial is focused on Meteor, which is a Javascript framework.
Because we want to teach you Meteor, we will already assume you know Javascript ES6, in order to keep this tutorial focused.

However, if you do need to learn Javascript, you can use these resources:

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript
